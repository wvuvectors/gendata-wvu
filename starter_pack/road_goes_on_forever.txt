STEP 5. SSH to the server spruce.hpc.wvu.edu, using your WVUID and password to login.

STEP 6. Examine (using ls) the contents of the directory '/scratch/tpd0001/gendata/starter_pack/'. What is the name of the text file in that directory?

STEP 7. In your local copy of the gendata-wvu repo, create a new text file using your last name (e.g., driscoll.txt).
